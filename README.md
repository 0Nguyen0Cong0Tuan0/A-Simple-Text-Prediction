# Simple Text Prediction

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a simple text generation model using a neural network. The model learns patterns from a given corpus and generates new text in a similar style by predicting the next word based on a seed text.

## Features
- Train a model on a given text corpus to understand word patterns.
- Predict the next word based on a provided seed text.
- Generate continuous text iteratively using previous predictions.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`main.ipynb`).
2. Follow the steps to train the model on a sample corpus.
3. Provide a seed text to generate new text predictions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12+
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on implementation)
- NumPy
- Pandas
